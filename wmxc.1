.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a small program that interacts with a 
.Xr wmx 1 
instance with the remoting feature enabled. This allows you to probe
and control wmx from the shell, allowing you to control it from SSH
sessions, scripts, and so on.
.Pp
wmx listens on port 6999 (can be changed) and can be controlled via
this port, but it can be harder to use interactively - there is no
shell parsing or readline to make it nice, and it harder to automate.
.Nm
should solve these problems.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -offset -indent
.It Fl p Ar port
A custom port to use. By default, wmx listens on 6999.
.It Fl q
Don't output anything.
