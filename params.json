{"name":"wmx","tagline":"fork of wmx window manager","body":"# wmx: another window manager\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NattyNarwhal/wmx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NattyNarwhal/wmx)\r\n\r\nwmx is another window manager for X.  It is based on wm2 and provides\r\na similarly unusual style of window decoration; but in place of wm2's\r\nminimal functionality it offers many of the features of more\r\nconventional managers, often in the most simplistic implementations\r\nimaginable.\r\n\r\nDocumentation can be found in the man page - you can read it with man:\r\n\r\n    # when wmx is installed:\r\n    $ man wmx\r\n    # GNU\r\n    $ man ./wmx.1\r\n    # BSD\r\n    $ mandoc wmx.1 | less\r\n\r\n## Building wmx\r\n\r\nwmx should build on any Unix machine with X11. In particular, it uses\r\nXpm, Xkb, Freetype, and strl\\* functions.\r\n\r\nYou might want to change the settings for wmx to suit your desires, and\r\nedit the Makefile as needed for your platform. By default, it should work\r\nout of the box on most OSes, but should be tweaked if you're not running a\r\ntypical Linux system. After that, you should be able to simply run make.\r\n\r\n## xterm\r\n\r\nSome versions of xterm and rxvt run badly with wmx.  If you use xterm\r\nand find that it refreshes the window excessively slowly, you might\r\nlike to try experimenting with a different terminal emulation program.\r\nI think it might help to ensure that the scrollbar is on the\r\nright-hand side of the rxvt window and is thick enough that wmx's\r\nresize handle doesn't obscure any of the text area.\r\n\r\n## NETWM and desktop environments\r\n\r\nAs of this release, wmx now includes a significant amount of support\r\nfor the NETWM extended window manager hints, enough to make it\r\nusable as the primary window manager with a GNOME or KDE desktop.\r\nThis support is incomplete; fixes and improvements will be welcomed\r\n(more than bug reports will).\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nwmx was written by Chris Cannam, recycling a lot of code and structure\r\nfrom \"9wm\" by David Hogan.\r\n\r\nThe sideways tabs on the window frames were Andy Green's idea.\r\n\r\nAlan Richardson's \"xvertext\" font-rotation routines are used for\r\nthe window tabs.\r\n\r\nKazushi (Jam) Marukawa provided internationalisation code, which I\r\nthink is currently only tested for Japanese; see README.contrib for\r\nhis notes and copyright notice.\r\n\r\nJeremy Fitzhardinge provided the original application-menu code.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic configuration code is mostly due to Stefan `Sec' Zehl.\r\n\r\nMultiheaded X support is due to Sven Oliver `SvOlli' Moll.\r\n\r\nNETWM support for use with desktop environments was based on a\r\nsubstantial patch from James Montgomery sent to the wmx mailing list\r\nin November 2000.  A mere seven years later, I got around to\r\nintegrating and updating the patch, and only eight years and two\r\nmonths after the original patch, here it is in a release.  Sorry about\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nEarlier Gnome support was mostly due to Henri Naccache, as is the\r\nsupport for shaped clients.\r\n\r\nThis release contains code and bug fixes provided by Eric Marsden,\r\nLasse Rasinen, Bill Spitzak, Jacques Garrigue, Stefan `Sec' Zehl, Sven\r\nOliver Moll, Richard Sharman, Martin Andrews, Glyn Faulkner, Zvezdan\r\nPetkovic, Damion Yates, Teemu Voipio, Ben Stern and, well, probably\r\nseveral other people.\r\n\r\nThis wmx fork is currently maintained by Calvin Buckley.\r\n\r\nIf you want to hack the code into something else for your own\r\namusement, please go ahead.  Feel free to modify and redistribute, as\r\nlong as you retain the original copyrights as appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Mailing list\r\n\r\nThere is a mailing list for discussion of wm2 and wmx, hosted by\r\nmajordomo at 42.org.
