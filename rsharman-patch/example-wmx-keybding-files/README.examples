Here are some example files suitable for the
~/.wmx/.keys or ~/.wmx/.mkeys directories.

In those directories the filename must be a valid KeySym.
You can find those by using the xev program,  or looking in
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h and removing the "XK_" prefix.
For example  instead of XK_KP_Subtract use KP_Subtract.
